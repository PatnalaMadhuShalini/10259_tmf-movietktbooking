errors occurred and were   fixed 
//   C:/Users/Satya/Documents/git/10259_tmf-movietktbooking/TMFMovieTicket/src/main/java/com/sat/tmf/movietkt/controller/PaymentController.java:[33,41] cannot find symbol
// [ERROR]   symbol:   method findById(java.lang.Integer)
// [ERROR]   location: variable bookingService of type com.sat.tmf.movietkt.service.BookingService
  to fix the above error  i  have created  method Booking findById(Integer bookingId); in booking service  to fix in the paymentcontroller.java
   As we added a method in the booking service, it  got an error in the bookingserviceimpl.java,  so  added the  method  public Booking findById(Integer bookingId) {
		return bookingDao.findById(bookingId) ;
	}

// [ERROR]   symbol:   method uniqueResult()
// [ERROR]   location: variable query of type jakarta.persistence.Query
The above error  means a line of code from a previous version of your project that used a Hibernate or older JPA implementation.It signifies a runtime issue in the database access layer you were in the process of replacing.
  So added  -> query.setMaxResults(1);
             return (Payment) ((org.hibernate.query.Query) query).uniqueResult();
